#### Build dataset

#Load data
raw <- read.csv('datasets/anes_timeseries_2020_csv_20220210.csv')

#Filter out responses that could not be validated
#data_validated <- raw %>% filter(V200004 == "3" & V200006 == "1" & V200007 == "1" & (V200008 == "1" | V200008 == "5"))

data <- raw %>% select(names(columns))
data <- data %>% rename_with(~ columns[.])

#### Filtering

### Voter Status
#Eliminate anyone who does not have any voter status info or who is not registered and did not vote
data <- data %>% filter(data$voter_post_vote_status_V202068x > 0)
#Not necessary to filter on voter turnout summary, as it is already a summary that includes V202068x
#data <- data %>% filter(data$voter_turnout_V202109x >= 0)

### Party Affiliation
#Eliminate anyone without a summary party ID value
#NOTE: Only reduces the dataset by < 20 rows - likely most voters that provided vote info also provided party info
data <- data %>% filter(data$party_pre_id_V201231x > 0)

#Not going to filter on registration because if we have party ID summary, this is enough to decide affiliation
#However, if lots of voters have conflicting ID and registration, we might want to revisit this
#NOTE: This significantly reduces the size of the dataset - most respondents don't have values for both of these questions
#data <- data %>% filter(data$party_prepost_registration_V202065x > 0)
#data <- data %>% filter(data$party_post_registration_V202064 > 0)


#### Cleanup

### Looking for columns with all NAs, none found
#not_all_na <- function(x) any(!is.na(x))
#dv <- dv %>% select(where(not_all_na))

### Auto type detection/conversion
# No need for this, as all selected columns are already Z
#data <- readr::type_convert(data)
