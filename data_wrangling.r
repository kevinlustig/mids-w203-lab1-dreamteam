## Filter Dataset by Voter Status and Party Affiliation ## 

### Voter Status ###
#Eliminate anyone who does not have any voter status info or who is not registered and did not vote
data <- data %>% filter(data$voter_post_vote_status_V202068x > 0)
# Note that the above drops the 1,227 people who we don't consider voters.

# Check how many people registered but did not vote 
sum(data$voter_post_vote_status_V202068x==1)
# ~650 people registered but did not vote. We will keep this group and consider them "voters" (intended to vote)
#Not necessary to filter on voter turnout summary, as it is already a summary that includes V202068x
#data <- data %>% filter(data$voter_turnout_V202109x >= 0)

### Party Affiliation ###
#Eliminate anyone without a summary party ID value
#NOTE: Only reduces the dataset by < 20 rows - likely most voters that provided vote info also provided party info
data <- data %>% filter(data$party_pre_id_V201231x > 0)

#Not going to filter on registration because if we have party ID summary, this is enough to decide affiliation
#However, if lots of voters have conflicting ID and registration, we might want to revisit this
#NOTE: This significantly reduces the size of the dataset - most respondents don't have values for both of these questions
#data <- data %>% filter(data$party_prepost_registration_V202065x > 0)
#data <- data %>% filter(data$party_post_registration_V202064 > 0)

## Cleanup

### Looking for columns with all NAs, none found
#not_all_na <- function(x) any(!is.na(x))
#dv <- dv %>% select(where(not_all_na))

### Auto type detection/conversion
# No need for this, as all selected columns are already Z
#data <- readr::type_convert(data)

### Determine Party Affiliation 

# Explore: how many are independent with no lean?
sum(data$party_pre_id_V201231x==4) #719 - a meaningful number
# We can't consider these members of either D or R party
# We are choosing NOT to use how they have voted in the past or in this election to tag them as a party
# Therefore we will leave them as "independent" for now (so we have three possible party tags - D, R, and I)
# If partyID is 1,2, or 3 (strong dem, not very strong dem, indep-dem), tag with D
# If partyID is 4 (indep) tag with I 
# If partyID is 5,6, or 7 (strong rep, not very strong rep, indep-rep), tag with R
